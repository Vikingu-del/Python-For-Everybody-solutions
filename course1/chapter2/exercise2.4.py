#xercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
#width = 17
#height = 12.0
#For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the
#type (of the value of the expression).
#1. width//2
#2. width/2.0
#3. height/3
#4. 1 + 2 * 5
#Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.
